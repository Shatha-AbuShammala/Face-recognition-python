# Face Recognition Project

A Python-based face recognition system that identifies individuals from live camera feed. 
This project demonstrates my skills in computer vision, image processing, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Features
- Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
- Recognizes registered individuals from a predefined folder (`persons`).
- Draws bounding boxes and labels recognized faces.
- Calculates face distance to improve recognition accuracy.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- face_recognition library
c- Git & GitHub for version control

## Workflow & Organization
- Each step of the project, from image encoding to real-time detection, was planned and executed methodically.
- Task tracking and progress management were done using Trello and Google Sheets to ensure deadlines were met and the workflow stayed organized.
- The project demonstrates attention to detail, problem-solving, and ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously — skills applicable to remote administrative roles.

## Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
